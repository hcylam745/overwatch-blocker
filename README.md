# Overwatch Blocking Tool

This is a simple tool that detects if Overwatch or Battle.Net (Blizzard's launcher for their games, including Overwatch) is open, and if it is, the tool automatically closes it. This is to help my friend improve his productivity.

<br/>
To use it, download the .zip file, and open the "Overwatch Blocker.exe" file in the dist folder.
