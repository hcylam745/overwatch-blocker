# Overwatch Blocking Tool

This is a simple tool that detects if Overwatch or Battle.Net (Blizzard's launcher for their games, including Overwatch) is open, and if it is, the tool automatically closes it. This is to help my friend improve his productivity.

<br/>
To use it, download the .zip file, and open the "Overwatch Blocker.exe" file in the dist folder.

When you click Timer, it changes the mode such that it constantly blocks the game until 'Completed Drawing' is clicked. 

<br/>

It is also possible to type numbers and backspaces to input numbers or remove numbers from the timer.
